    ## Order status

    | Status | Description |
    | ----- | ------------ |
    | NEW | Shipment created but without any management. |.
    | PICKUP | Shipping is located to assign a route to pick up. |
    | GOTO_PICK | On the way to be picked up (the delivery person is going to the pick-up point). |
    | ARRIVED_PICK | The driver (chazki) is located at the pick-up point/place. |
    | PICKING | The package was picked up. |

    ## Webhook

    To access the notification mechanism via webhooks, you must tell us what will be the
    url to which the status change notifications of an order will be sent.

    It is important that the hook URL must start with the protocol (https) and take into account
    Note that all pushes will be of type POST. All webhooks expect a
    response with code 200.

    It is recommended that the response with code 200 be done asynchronously to
    avoid timeout errors.

    ### STATE PUSH

    This information will be sent each time the status of a shipment is updated and
    will be sent with the following body:

    ```
    {
      "delivery_code": "4957783420",
      "delivery_status": "DELIVERED",
      "timestamp": "2022-02-04T22:44:30.652Z",
      "url_delivery_code": "https://nintendo.chazki.com/trackcodeTracking/4957783420"
    }
    ```
